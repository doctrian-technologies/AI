# Welcome to the Doctrian AI Repository!

### The Repository is open to all and I invite anyone working in the field of AI to contribute to this resource.

AI is the capability of a machine to imitate intelligent human behavior. Through AI, machines can analyze images, comprehend speech, interact in natural ways and make predictions using data. (AI) technologies are quickly transforming almost every sphere of our lives.

#### Artificial intelligence can be classified into three different types of systems:
##### Analytical
##### Human-inspired
##### Humanized artificial intelligence

## Neural Network

A Neural Network is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodology that attempts to mimic the behavior of the neurons in our brains.  Neural networks really shine when it comes to pattern recognition and are used in image and character recognition programs, data filtering applications, and even robotics. A neural net was even used to drive an automated vehicle across the US after learning from observing human drivers.  In this article, we'll be building a basic framework for AI Neural Networks in C# and teach our program to perform basic X-OR operations.
